# Cleaning_Data_Code_Along
1st Code Along project where I followed instructions for cleaning data from a dataset of audiobooks

This notebook and resources come from DataCamp Code Along series.
It's goal was to navigate through a dataset with wrong data types and complicated values, extracting only the useful information from each data point and exporting into a new data set.
